## Backend Architecture

### Database Models Used
1. **UserProgress** - Stores user XP, level, streaks, and skill progression
2. **UserBadge** - Tracks earned badges and progress
3. **Badge** - Badge definitions and requirements
4. **GameSession** - Completed game sessions with scores and feedback

### Service Layer

#### ProgressService (`server/services/progressService.ts`)
**Methods:**
- `getUserProgress(userId)` - Retrieves/creates user progress record
- `getUserBadges(userId)` - Gets all badges with progress calculations
- `checkAndAwardBadges(userId)` - Automatically awards earned badges
- `getGameHistory(userId, limit)` - Fetches user's game session history
- `getWeeklyReport(userId)` - Generates comprehensive weekly performance report

#### LLMService Enhancement (`server/services/llmService.ts`)
**New Methods:**
- `generateWeeklyInsights(params)` - AI-powered weekly performance analysis
- `generateFallbackInsights(params)` - Rule-based insights when AI unavailable

**AI Insight Generation:**
- Uses OpenAI (gpt-3.5-turbo) or Anthropic (claude-3-haiku-20240307)
- Analyzes 7 days of activity patterns
- Identifies strengths, improvements, and behavioral insights
- Generates personalized, culturally-sensitive feedback
- Automatic fallback to rule-based system

### Routes
**File:** `server/routes/progressRoutes.ts`

All routes require authentication via `requireUser(ALL_ROLES)` middleware.

```typescript
GET /api/progress/badges          // Get user badges
GET /api/progress/history         // Get game history (optional ?limit=N)
GET /api/progress/weekly-report   // Get weekly report with AI insights
```

## Frontend Integration

### API Client (`client/src/api/progress.ts`)
Updated to remove mock data and connect to real backend endpoints:

```typescript
export const getBadges = async () => {
  const response = await api.get('/api/progress/badges');
  return response.data;
};

export const getGameHistory = async (limit?: number) => {
  const response = await api.get('/api/progress/history', { params: { limit } });
  return { sessions: response.data.history };
};

export const getWeeklyReport = async () => {
  const response = await api.get('/api/progress/weekly-report');
  return response.data;
};
```

### Progress Page (`client/src/pages/Progress.tsx`)
The Progress page consumes these endpoints to display:
- Skill progression overview
- Badge collection with earned/locked states
- Game history with feedback
- Weekly performance report with AI insights

## Testing

### Test Script
**File:** `server/scripts/test-progress.ts`

**Run:** `npm run test:progress`

**Test Coverage:**
1. ✓ User registration and authentication
2. ✓ GET /api/progress/badges - Structure and fields validation
3. ✓ Game session creation for testing
4. ✓ GET /api/progress/history - Structure and fields validation
5. ✓ GET /api/progress/history with limit parameter
6. ✓ GET /api/progress/weekly-report - All fields validation
7. ✓ Weekly report summary data
8. ✓ AI insights validation (strengths, improvements, insights, summary)
9. ✓ Weekly activity data (7 days)
10. ✓ Category breakdown validation
11. ✓ Authentication requirement verification

**Test Results Format:**
```
✓ PASS: User Registration - Test user registered successfully
✓ PASS: Get Badges - Structure - Received 10 badges
✓ PASS: Get Badges - Fields - Badge has all required fields
✓ PASS: Get Weekly Report - AI Summary - AI-generated summary present
...
Total Tests: 15
Passed: 15 ✓
Failed: 0 ✗
Success Rate: 100%
```

## AI Integration Details

### Weekly Insights Generation
The system generates personalized weekly insights using LLM providers:

**Input Data:**
- Total games played
- Total XP earned
- Total time spent
- Average accuracy
- Category breakdown (language, culture, soft-skills)
- Daily activity patterns
- User level

**Output:**
- 3-4 specific strengths
- 2-3 actionable improvements
- 3-4 data-driven insights
- Comprehensive AI-generated summary

**Fallback Strategy:**
- If no API key is configured → Rule-based insights
- If LLM API fails → Rule-based insights
- If JSON parsing fails → Rule-based insights

**Rule-Based Insights:**
- Performance-based strength identification
- Pattern-based improvement suggestions
- Activity-based insights (best day, consistency, etc.)
- Motivational summary based on performance tier

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Required in `server/.env`:
```env
# At least one of these for AI insights
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...          # Optional: For OpenAI GPT
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...   # Optional: For Anthropic Claude
```

**Note:** AI insights work without API keys via intelligent fallback system.

## Database Indexes

### Optimized Queries
```javascript
// UserBadge
{ userId: 1, badgeId: 1 } - unique compound index
{ userId: 1, earnedAt: 1 } - for earned badges queries

// GameSession
{ userId: 1, completedAt: -1 } - for history queries
{ userId: 1, gameId: 1 } - for game-specific queries

// Badge
{ category: 1, xpRequired: 1, isActive: 1 } - for badge listings
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Badge Progress Calculation:**
   - Cached user progress to avoid multiple DB queries
   - Single query for all badges
   - Single query for user badge records

2. **Game History:**
   - Indexed queries by userId and completedAt
   - Configurable limit for pagination
   - Populated game details in single query

3. **Weekly Report:**
   - Single aggregated query for 7-day sessions
   - In-memory calculations for statistics
   - Async AI generation with fallback

## Security

1. **Authentication:**
   - All endpoints require valid JWT token
   - User can only access their own data
   - userId extracted from authenticated token

2. **Data Validation:**
   - MongoDB ObjectId validation
   - Input sanitization via middleware
   - Type checking on all parameters

3. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Inherits from API-level rate limiting
   - AI generation has built-in retry logic (max 3 attempts)

## Error Handling

### Common Errors
```javascript
// Invalid user ID
401 Unauthorized - "User not authenticated"

// No progress found (auto-creates default)
200 OK with default progress

// Database errors
500 Internal Server Error

// AI generation failure
Falls back to rule-based insights (transparent to user)
```

## Usage Examples

### Get User Badges
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/progress/badges \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Get Game History (Last 5 Sessions)
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/progress/history?limit=5" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Get Weekly Report
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/progress/weekly-report \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Badges:**
   - Special event badges
   - Social collaboration badges
   - Achievement animations

2. **History:**
   - Filter by category
   - Date range queries
   - Export functionality

3. **Weekly Report:**
   - Monthly/yearly reports
   - Comparative analysis (week-over-week)
   - Goal setting and tracking
   - Streak analysis
   - Best time-of-day insights

4. **AI Insights:**
   - Learning style detection
   - Personalized game recommendations
   - Difficulty level suggestions
   - Study schedule optimization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Badges not showing progress
- **Solution:** Ensure user has UserProgress record (auto-created on first access)
- **Check:** Badge xpRequired values in database

**Issue:** Weekly report shows 0 games
- **Solution:** User needs to complete games within last 7 days
- **Verify:** GameSession records exist with correct timestamps

**Issue:** AI insights not personalized
- **Solution:** Check if OPENAI_API_KEY or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set
- **Fallback:** System uses rule-based insights automatically

**Issue:** Game history not showing game details
- **Solution:** Ensure GameSession records are properly populated
- **Check:** Game documents exist and are referenced correctly
