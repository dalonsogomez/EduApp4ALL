### Test Scripts
6. **`server/scripts/test-game-session.ts`**
   - Comprehensive test suite for game session tracking
   - Tests 9 scenarios:
     1. User authentication
     2. Fetch available games
     3. Get game details
     4. Submit high-score session (80%)
     5. Submit low-score session (40%)
     6. Retrieve specific session by ID
     7. Retrieve all user sessions
     8. Filter sessions by game
     9. Verify XP and progress updates

## API Endpoints

### 1. Submit Game Session with AI Feedback
```
POST /api/games/:id/session
Authorization: Bearer <token>

Request:
{
  "score": number,
  "maxScore": number,
  "timeSpent": number,  // seconds
  "answers": [{
    "questionIndex": number,
    "selectedAnswer": number,
    "isCorrect": boolean,
    "pointsEarned": number
  }]
}

Response:
{
  "session": {
    "_id": string,
    "userId": string,
    "gameId": string,
    "score": number,
    "maxScore": number,
    "xpEarned": number,
    "timeSpent": number,
    "completedAt": string,
    "answers": [...],
    "feedback": {
      "strengths": string[],
      "improvements": string[],
      "tips": string[],
      "nextRecommendations": string[],
      "personalizedMessage": string
    }
  },
  "xpEarned": number,
  "feedback": { ... }
}
```

### 2. Get Specific Game Session
```
GET /api/games/sessions/:sessionId
Authorization: Bearer <token>

Response:
{
  "session": { ... }  // Full session with populated game info
}
```

### 3. Get User's Game Sessions
```
GET /api/games/sessions?gameId=...&startDate=...&endDate=...&limit=...
Authorization: Bearer <token>

Query Parameters:
- gameId (optional): Filter by specific game
- startDate (optional): Filter from date (ISO string)
- endDate (optional): Filter to date (ISO string)
- limit (optional): Max number of results (default: 50)

Response:
{
  "sessions": [{ ... }]  // Array of sessions with populated game info
}
```

## AI Feedback Generation

### How It Works
1. Collects game performance data (score, time, answers)
2. Fetches user profile (level, target language)
3. Constructs detailed prompt for LLM with:
   - Game metadata
   - Performance metrics
   - Individual question results
   - User context
4. Sends to OpenAI or Anthropic (provider auto-selected based on available API keys)
5. Parses JSON response
6. Falls back to rule-based feedback if AI fails

### Fallback Feedback Logic
When AI is unavailable or fails:
- **High performance (≥80%)**: Encourages mastery, suggests harder challenges
- **Medium performance (60-79%)**: Highlights understanding, suggests continued practice
- **Low performance (<60%)**: Encourages persistence, suggests review and retry
- Category-specific tips (language, culture, soft-skills)

### LLM Prompt Design
The prompt is designed to be:
- **Encouraging**: Growth mindset, celebrates effort
- **Culturally sensitive**: Appropriate for refugees/immigrants
- **Simple language**: Suitable for language learners
- **Specific**: References actual performance details
- **Actionable**: Provides concrete next steps

## Key Features

### 1. Comprehensive Session Tracking
- Records every answer with correctness and points
- Tracks time spent
- Calculates XP proportional to score
- Updates user progress and levels

### 2. AI-Powered Feedback
- Personalized to user level and target language
- Analyzes specific mistakes
- Provides targeted recommendations
- Warm, motivating tone

### 3. Progress Integration
- Automatically updates UserProgress model
- Awards XP based on performance
- Updates skill-specific XP (language/culture/soft-skills)
- Maintains streak tracking
- Level progression system

### 4. Session History
- Query by game
- Filter by date range
- Limit results
- Populated with game details

### 5. Error Handling
- Graceful fallback when AI unavailable
- Validates all inputs
- Proper error messages
- Logs for debugging

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Optional - for AI-powered feedback
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
# OR
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key

# If neither is provided, system uses rule-based fallback feedback
```

## Usage Examples

### Frontend - Submit Game Session
```typescript
import { submitGameSession } from '@/api/games';

// After user completes game
const result = await submitGameSession(gameId, {
  score: 80,
  maxScore: 100,
  timeSpent: 420,  // 7 minutes
  answers: [
    { questionIndex: 0, selectedAnswer: 2, isCorrect: true, pointsEarned: 10 },
    { questionIndex: 1, selectedAnswer: 1, isCorrect: false, pointsEarned: 0 },
    // ...
  ]
});

console.log(`Earned ${result.xpEarned} XP!`);
console.log(`Feedback: ${result.feedback.personalizedMessage}`);
```

### Frontend - View Session History
```typescript
import { getGameSessions } from '@/api/games';

// Get all sessions for a specific game
const { sessions } = await getGameSessions({ gameId: '123', limit: 10 });

// Get sessions from last week
const lastWeek = new Date();
lastWeek.setDate(lastWeek.getDate() - 7);
const { sessions } = await getGameSessions({
  startDate: lastWeek.toISOString(),
  limit: 20
});
```

## Testing

### Run All Tests
```bash
cd server
npm run seed          # First, populate database with test data
npm run dev           # Start server in another terminal
npm run test:game-session
```

### Test Coverage
- ✅ User authentication
- ✅ Game retrieval
- ✅ Session submission with various scores
- ✅ AI feedback generation
- ✅ Session retrieval by ID
- ✅ Session history with filtering
- ✅ Progress updates
- ✅ XP calculation

## Performance Considerations

1. **AI Response Time**: 1-3 seconds typical, falls back to rule-based if timeout
2. **Session Creation**: Asynchronous, doesn't block response
3. **Indexes**: Optimized queries on userId, gameId, completedAt
4. **Pagination**: Default limit of 50 sessions prevents large payloads

## Future Enhancements

1. **Batch AI Processing**: Generate feedback for multiple sessions at once
2. **Caching**: Cache similar feedback patterns
3. **A/B Testing**: Compare AI vs rule-based feedback effectiveness
4. **Analytics**: Track which feedback leads to improvement
5. **Multilingual Feedback**: Generate feedback in user's native language
6. **Voice Feedback**: Text-to-speech for feedback messages
7. **Gamification**: Badges for consistent improvement
8. **Social Features**: Share achievements with other learners

## Logs for Debugging

The implementation includes meaningful logs:
- `[GameService]` - Session creation, XP calculation
- `[LLMService]` - AI provider selection, feedback generation, fallbacks
- All endpoints log requests and errors

Example log flow:
```
[GameService] Submitting game session for user: 123 game: 456
[GameService] Generating AI-powered feedback
[LLMService] Using openai to generate feedback
[LLMService] Successfully generated feedback
[GameService] Game session created with ID: 789 XP earned: 75
[GameService] User progress updated, new total XP: 450
```

## Notes

- The system works WITHOUT AI API keys (uses fallback feedback)
- Feedback is stored in MongoDB for future analysis
- All endpoints require authentication
- Session data includes full answer history for learning analytics
- XP calculation is proportional to score: `(score/maxScore) * gameXPReward`
